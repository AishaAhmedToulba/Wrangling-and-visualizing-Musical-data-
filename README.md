*  This project is a datacamp practice project that I have done while studying the data scientist with R track :)

## üëÄ Scenario

<img src="https://www.referenceforbusiness.com/photos/planning-234.jpg" width="120px">

- The main question of this project is centered around :  How do musicians choose the chords they use in their songs? Do guitarists, pianists, and singers gravitate towards different kinds of harmony?

## üéØ Objectives  

**1. Uncover trends in the kinds of chord progressions used by popular artists.The dataset includes professionally tagged chords for several hundred pop/rock songs representative of singles that made the Billboard Hot 100 list between 1958 and 1991.**

**2. Explore the most common chords and chord progressions in these songs.**

**3. Contrast the harmonies of some guitar-led and piano-led artists to see where the "affordances" of those instruments may affect the chord choices artists make.**
 
 
 ## ‚öôÔ∏è Process:
 
 1. **Setting up our working environment**: Github repository & Jupyter Notebook 
 2. **Data  Understanding**:
 - Understanding the meaning of each variable in the Music Industry context 
 - Analyzing the style of musical artists through the understanding of the kind of chords they use in their songs.
 
 3. **Data Exploration**: 
 - Performing preliminary Data Cleaning to prepare the data for the analysis.
  - Analysis and Visualization in Jupyter Notebook.
  
  ## üìå Outcomes:
  
  - we have seen  that a difference in chord frequency would be reflected in a difference in chord bigram frequency indeed!!
  - In a large representative sample of pop/rock songs from the historical Billboard charts, the chords most often learned first by guitarists and pianists are the most common.
  - In fact, chords commonly deemed easy or beginner-friendly on both piano and guitar are far and away the most common in the corpus.
